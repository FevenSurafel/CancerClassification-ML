# CancerClassification-ML
Prepared by Derick Cazares, Melissa Morales, Renee Perez, and Feven Surafel

## Overview
The objective of this project is to utilize the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset for predictive analysis to improve early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to develop a predictive model that can classify tumor samples as malignant or benign based on various features extracted from cell nuclei.

## Results

**Machine Learning Linear Regression Model (XXX% Accuracy)**

* Class B (Benign Diagnosis)
    * Precision is XXX, meaning all predicted class B instances are XXX
    * Recall is XXX, meaning XXX% of actual class B instances were XXX
   
* Class M (Malignant Diagnosis)
    * Precision is XXX, meaning all predicted class B instances are XXX
    * Recall is XXX, meaning XXX% of actual class B instances were XXX

## Analysis

PLACEHOLDER:

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).


## Summary

PLACEHOLDER:

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
